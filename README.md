Flutter Project: Advanced Task Manager

Introducing an enhanced version of a task management application, designed to streamline your productivity and assist you in managing your tasks with precision. This feature-rich Flutter project offers an array of capabilities:

1)Time-Driven Reminders:

Stay punctual and organized with this app's precise time-based reminders. Receive notifications at the exact times you've specified for your specific tasks.

2)Real-Time Location Sharing:

In addition to managing your tasks, this app provides real-time location status sharing, allowing you to keep tabs on the whereabouts of your contacts.

3)Location-Based Task Reminders:

Simplify your task management further with location-based reminders. Simply input the coordinates of a particular location, and when you're within a 1 km radius of that spot, your phone will promptly notify you. No more missing essential tasks when you're in the right place.
